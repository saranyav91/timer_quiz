Name:
Time based client side Quiz

Description:
From scratch, we build a timer-based quiz application that stores high scores client-side.
The Play proceeds as follows:
1.The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.
2.Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.
3.Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).
4.When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in localStorage.
